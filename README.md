# Smart Production Dashboard

A comprehensive and interactive dashboard designed to monitor and optimize the performance of a saline production machine. It integrates real-time analytics for:

- 📊 Machine metrics and Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)
- ⚠️ Anomaly detection using statistical process control (SPC) and ML models
- 🌱 Carbon emission tracking (water, energy, and air usage)
- 📈 Advanced visualizations (2D, 3D, heatmaps, pie charts, area charts, SPC charts)
- 📄 Automated PDF report generation
- ✏️ Manual annotation and interactive plotting features

## Target Users

- **Factory Managers**: Monitor operations and efficiency
- **Environmental Officers**: Ensure sustainability compliance
- **Quality Assurance Teams**: Maintain consistent product quality
- **Maintenance Technicians**: Detect early signs of malfunction or inefficiency

## Key Features

- Dynamic time-based filtering
- Control limit (UCL/LCL) calculations
- Process capability analysis (Cp, Cpk)
- Anomaly detection via SPC rules
- Real-time data visualization & annotation
- PDF reporting of SPC analysis
- User-friendly, rotatable 3D plots

> Built with Python, Streamlit, Bokeh, and MySQL.
